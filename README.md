Nepal Stock Simulator is a free NEPSE trading simulator for students and beginners who want to learn investing in Nepal without risking real money. It teaches how the Nepal Stock Exchange works using a simple credit based practice flow, a clean interface, and helpful insights for smarter decisions.

The goal is simple. Make financial literacy in Nepal practical and accessible. Users can explore virtual stock trading, read market summaries, track portfolio performance, and build confidence before touching real NEPSE trades. This is a learning tool first and a simulator second, designed to build habits like patience, basic analysis, and risk awareness.

Tech overview. Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Backend uses Flask in Python. Hosting uses Cloudflare Pages for the frontend and Render for the backend. Design references come from modern trading platforms so the experience feels familiar even for first time users.
